<b> On the completed app, you are able to send messeges to others using an EditTextView<br>
<b> The applications code is based off two parts, one is the receive message portion whilst the other is send message.
<b> Both parts of the code need to work in conjunction with each other for the application to work seemlessly. 
<b> When you open the app you can type in your message and press send.
<b> It will then go to a screen where you can choose your contact.
<b> Then the message sends.
